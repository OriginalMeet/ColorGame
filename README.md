# ColorGame

Here is the Link to Play the Game: https://originalmeet.github.io/ColorGame/

In this project, I have created an RGB colour guessing game with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This Game is simple the website will give you an RGB colour value like (255,0,0) and you will have to try to guess which colour is it in this case the colour will be red so you have to click on the right colour to win the game. I have introduced two game modes here one is Easy mode where you will have to select the right colour from 3 colours and in the Hard Mode you have to select the right colour from 6 colours.
